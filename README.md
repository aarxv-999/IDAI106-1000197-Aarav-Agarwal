## Summative Assessment 6

### Overview

The scenario that I am addressing via this project is Scenario 1: Designing‬‭ Social‬‭ Media‬‭ Detox‬‭ Tracker‬‭ App‬‭ prototype‬‭ using‬‭ Design‬ Thinking‬‭. MindSpace is a mobile app which is designed for young users (such as students, teenagers, and working professionals) who face struggles with excessive screen time and social media usage. The app aids them in tracking, limiting, and reflecting on their social media activity, in a way that motivates them, not restricts. I used the design thinking framework to create this app with empathy, simplicity and a purpose, to turn insights from real users into a prototype to support digital wellness. <br/>

## Design Thinking Process

### Empathize & Define

1. Conducted surveys via Google Forms with more than 10 users to better understand the emotional triggers and struggles with screen time
2. Created empathy maps and user personas to define the pain points, needs and individual motivations.
3. Survey insights and empathy maps can be found in surveyresults.md and empathymap.md

Problem Statement: "How might we design a screen time tracker app which helps younger users decrease their social media usage in a way that feels motivating, guilt-free, and fun without forcing them to quit entirely?"

### Ideate 

Brainstormed features like
1. Visual progress tracking
2. Goal setting with custom time limits
3. Daily detox challenges
4. Rewards system (coins and badges)
5. Relaxation suggestion engine
6. Family sync features

Final feature sets and wireframes are available in wireframe.md

 

### Prototype 

Created an aesthetic high fidelity prototype with intuitive, minimalistic & on point screens. All screens can be seen in allscreens.pdf 

Key screens: 
1. Login & sign up
2. Home dashboard
3. Tracking & Analytics
4. Detox Goals and Challenges
5. Profile hub (Relaxation suggestions, family sync settings, profile settings, notification settings) 

The video to show case the prototype can be found at Prototype Showcase.mov


### Test

Shared the prototype with users to get some feedback. <br/> 
Collected user input via google forms and made improvements based on the suggestions (e.g., animationm fixes, button fixes, etc.) <br/>

All feedback details and the fixes can be found in feedbackform.md
